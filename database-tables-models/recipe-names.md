## How i can fetch all recipes that we have

So in order to get data about recipes, you can use swagger link: [http://localhost:3000/explorer/\#!/Recipe/Recipe\_find](http://localhost:3000/explorer/#!/Recipe/Recipe_find)  
or  
[http://localhost:3000/api/recipe](http://localhost:3000/api/recipe)

## Have you had a chance to answer the previous question?

Yes, after a few months we finally found the answer. Sadly, Mike is on vacations right now so I'm afraid we are not able to provide the answer at this point.
