# Main Intro

**GraphQL**

Search API - abstract version, without connecting to database

Check models for current project you can find here: 

You should recreate a samlpe logic from from scratch. But spend time and make it adjustable. Keep in mind that main function for this server is to return data only. We didn't add new database items, not deleting them.



It should be not very difficult, huh? Create a separated repo in our code repository, where we'll keep schemas for this project.

This will help us. You should make this schema with help of our other team members. So you'll need to create a plan and separate roles, tasks, so one will create types, other queries, etc. Later you'll merge them and test how it work together.

Keep in mind that we like to change schemes a lot, so you should be aware about this. 

You should also create a simple explanation document - readme file that will explain how everything works. This will help you later and will speed up the process of other developers, involved to development process.
